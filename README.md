#### Description: Final project cs50, about time management
This is a web application that is based on helping you organize and value every minute of your time, we all know how precious our time can be and we should value every second of it, but there are few tools that help us with this task.

The project's function is to serve as an agenda and show several motivational phrases to the user during the day, the data filled in the forms are stored in an SQL database. The website design was built using the bootstrap framework.

# Acknowledgment

I would first like to thank the CS50 team for showing me this wonderful world of programming and for teaching me many things that I will take with me throughout my life. Without you, this like other projects I built in my life would not exist

We use Python to import Flask flamework like this along with its libraries
that are useful both for application development and also for interaction
with the SQL database that serves to store and manage the information of our
application.

```python

# You have to install the cs50 library via terminal by:

$ pip3 install cs50


```

## To rotate

To run the application run the following line commands


```python

# If you don't have Flask installed or are using this app for the first time
cd myproject

# Will install some project dependencies

python3 -m venv venv 

# To activate the corresponding environment

. venv/bin/activate 

# Will install flask library

pip install Flask

# Will make your web app run. 
# Run this command only if inside the myproject page

flask run

```

If you already have Flask installed or have already accessed this project

```python

cd my project

. venv/bin/activate

flask run
```

# Database

Run the following commands to view the data in the database

```bash

# Make sure you have SQL installed on your machine 
# If you don't have it installed on your machine
